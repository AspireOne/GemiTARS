# Performance Analysis Report

## Objective

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the computational efficiency of the `pi_software` and identify potential areas for optimization to ensure smooth performance on a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

## Summary of Findings

The analysis identified the hotword detection loop as the most computationally intensive part of the application. The performance is primarily influenced by the neural network inference and the handling of audio data. While the current implementation is functional, several key areas for optimization have been identified that could significantly reduce CPU and memory usage.

A detailed plan with specific implementation guidance for these optimizations is available in [`docs/performance_optimization_plan.md`](docs/performance_optimization_plan.md).

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Computationally Intensive Areas

*   **Conclusion:** The `HotwordDetector.process_audio` method, specifically the call to `self.oww.predict()`, is the primary performance bottleneck.
*   **Details:** This method runs a neural network inference on every 100ms audio chunk, which is an inherently CPU-intensive operation. The performance of this loop directly impacts the overall responsiveness of the client.

### 2. Hotword Detection Loop Performance

*   **Conclusion:** The hotword detection loop can be optimized by changing the inference framework and audio chunk size.
*   **Details:** The system is currently configured to use the ONNX inference framework and a 100ms audio chunk size. The `openwakeword` documentation suggests that the TFLite framework is often more performant on ARM devices, and that an audio chunk size that is a multiple of 80ms is more efficient for the library's internal processing.

### 3. Audio Processing and Streaming Performance

*   **Conclusion:** The audio processing and streaming pipeline is efficient and not a primary source of performance issues.
*   **Details:** The use of `sounddevice` for audio I/O and `websockets` for streaming are standard and performant. The data handling is straightforward and does not contain unnecessary processing steps.

### 4. Memory Allocation Patterns

*   **Conclusion:** There are opportunities to reduce memory allocations and copies in the audio pipeline.
*   **Details:** The current implementation involves several conversions between `numpy` arrays and `bytes` objects as audio data flows from the microphone to the hotword detector. Each conversion creates a copy of the audio chunk in memory. While small, these frequent allocations can increase memory pressure and garbage collector activity.

## Final Recommendation

The `pi_software` is well-structured, but its performance on a low-power device can be significantly improved by implementing the changes outlined in the [`docs/performance_optimization_plan.md`](docs/performance_optimization_plan.md). The highest priority should be given to switching the inference framework to TFLite, as this is expected to yield the most substantial performance gains.
