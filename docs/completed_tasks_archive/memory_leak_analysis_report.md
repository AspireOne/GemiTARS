# Memory Leak Analysis Report

28.07.2025 (dd.mm.yyyy)

## Objective

The objective of this analysis was to perform a thorough verification of the `pi_software` codebase to identify any potential memory leaks or similar resource management issues, with a special focus on microphone recording, audio streaming, and hotword detection components.

## Summary of Findings

After a comprehensive review of the relevant components, **no evidence of memory leaks or significant resource management issues was found.** The code appears to be robust and follows best practices for managing audio streams, buffers, and asynchronous tasks.

## Detailed Analysis

The analysis was broken down into four key areas:

### 1. `sounddevice` Stream Management

*   **Conclusion:** No leaks found.
*   **Details:** The `pc_audio_manager.py` class correctly manages the lifecycle of `sounddevice` input and output streams. Streams are created when needed and are consistently stopped and closed in all execution paths, including error conditions and application shutdown. The use of `try...finally` blocks ensures that resources are released reliably.

### 2. `openwakeword` Prediction Buffer Behavior

*   **Conclusion:** No leaks found.
*   **Details:** The initial concern was that the `prediction_buffer` in the `openwakeword` library could grow indefinitely. A review of the `openwakeword` source code revealed that the buffer is implemented as a `collections.deque` with a fixed `maxlen`. This data structure automatically discards old predictions, preventing the buffer from growing without bounds.

### 3. Callback Implementations & Reference Cycles

*   **Conclusion:** No dangerous reference cycles found.
*   **Details:** The analysis confirmed the existence of reference cycles between the core components of the application (e.g., `SessionManager`, `HotwordDetector`). However, these objects are long-lived and intended to exist for the application's entire lifecycle. These cycles are expected in this type of architecture and are not a concern as they will be cleaned up by the Python garbage collector upon application exit.

### 4. `asyncio.Task` Lifecycle Management

*   **Conclusion:** No leaks found.
*   **Details:** All `asyncio` tasks are managed correctly. Long-running tasks, such as the audio playback handler, have a clear lifecycle and are properly cancelled during shutdown. Short-lived tasks are created and managed in a way that does not lead to leaked task objects.

## Final Recommendation

The `pi_software` codebase, particularly the components responsible for audio processing, is well-structured and appears to be free of memory leaks. No corrective actions are recommended at this time.
