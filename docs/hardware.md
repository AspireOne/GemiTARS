# Hardware

IMPROVEMENT:
Tap his head to activate!! 100% reliability, less hassle, will start the conversation right away, and also is comical when you bonk his head and he says "Huh?!!"

This document outlines the specifications, hardware integration, pinout, and setup for the hardware of this project - using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W in a TARS-inspired voice assistant robot. The design focuses on local wake word detection (via OpenWakeWord), ALSA audio filtering (e.g., 100Hz-4000Hz for voice), and relaying audio to a remote server for processing. Components are chosen for compactness, low cost, and flexibility in a 3D-printed enclosed case.

## Why Raspberry Pi Zero 2W?

- **Rationale**: The Pi Zero 2W is chosen over alternatives (e.g., ESP32) for better local wake word detection reliability (via OpenWakeWord) (regular esp32 cannot do local wake word detection at all), flexible component positioning in a TARS enclosure, and easier integration of displays/cameras/servos. It supports simultaneous I2S audio input/output, leaving GPIOs free for expansions like servos for articulating panels.
- **Trade-offs**: Boot time is ~30-40 seconds (vs. instant on ESP32), and power consumption is higher (~100-300mA), but it's efficient for wall-powered or short-battery use. Enclosure considerations (e.g., acoustic holes for mic/speaker) are critical to avoid muffled sound or echo.
- **Efficiency**: Low total cost (~$50-100), compact for 3D-printed TARS case, and scalable (e.g., add second mic later for stereo processing).

### Components

- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (with pre-soldered GPIO headers)**:  
  Core processor for local wake word detection and I/O.  
  **WHY**: Headers allow easy, non-destructive wiring for prototyping  
  and flexible positioning in the TARS enclosure.

- **INMP441 I2S Microphone (single for now)**:  
  Digital mic for high-quality voice input.  
  **WHY**: Compact, low-noise, and ideal for wake word detection;  
  single mic reduces initial complexity while supporting future stereo upgrade.  
  Position behind enclosure holes for acoustics.

- **3W 4Ω Speaker with MAX98357A I2S Digital Amplifier Breakout Board**:  
  Small speaker (e.g., 40-50mm diameter) amplified for TTS playback.  
  **WHY**: Provides clear, amplified audio without buzzing (better than PWM);  
  I2S bus supports simultaneous mic input/output, so no conflicts.  
  Amp is tiny (~20mm x 20mm x 3mm) for enclosure fit.  
  **Alternative**: PWM with analog amp (e.g., PAM8403) avoids I2S  
  but may have lower quality/noise issues.

- **SPI Display (e.g., 0.96" OLED like SSD1306)**:  
  Small screen for TARS panel visuals.  
  **WHY**: Low-power, compact, and easy to position on enclosure walls  
  via flexible wires; SPI interface is efficient and leaves pins free.

- **Pi Camera Module (e.g., official Raspberry Pi Camera v2 or mini version)**:  
  For future multimodal input.  
  **WHY**: Native CSI connection with ribbon cable allows flexible positioning  
  (e.g., in TARS "eye" area); low power and small form factor.

- **MicroSD Card (16GB+ Class 10, e.g., SanDisk)**:  
  For OS storage.  
  **WHY**: Essential for booting Raspberry Pi OS;  
  high-speed card ensures smooth performance.

- **Power Supply**:  
  5V 2.5A microUSB adapter (wall power) + optional 2000mAh LiPo battery  
  with UPS module (e.g., PiSugar).  
  **WHY**: Provides stable power; UPS prevents SD corruption  
  during shutdowns for portable TARS use.

- **Wiring Accessories**:  
  Female-to-female Dupont jumper wires (various lengths),  
  optional breadboard/perfboard for prototyping.  
  **WHY**: Enables flexible component placement in the enclosed case  
  without soldering everything permanently.

## Software Configuration

- **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless for efficiency).
- **I2S Enable**: Edit `/boot/config.txt` with `dtparam=i2s=on` and `dtoverlay=i2s-mmap`; reboot.
- **Audio Setup**: Use ALSA for mic filtering (e.g., `.asoundrc` for 100Hz-4000Hz bandpass) and testing (`arecord` for input, `aplay` for output).
- **Wake Word**: Install OpenWakeWord for local detection; integrate with server relay scripts (e.g., Python with PyAudio).
- **Display/Camera**: Use libraries like Luma.OLED for display and Picamera2 for camera.
- **WHY**: Keeps processing light on the Pi, offloading heavy logic to the server while enabling low-latency local features.

## Future Expansions

- Add second mic for stereo (share SD pin on GPIO20).
- Servos for TARS panels (e.g., on GPIO13/16 for PWM).
- Echo cancellation (software via WebRTC or hardware WM8960 codec).
- Status LED (e.g., on GPIO4) for debugging.
